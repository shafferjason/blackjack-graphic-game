## Card Visuals — Face Card Design

### Design Approach

The face card SVG artwork (Jack, Queen, King) is **100% original
procedural SVG code** written from scratch. No image files, SVG paths,
or artwork were traced, copied, or derived from any proprietary or
commercial playing card deck.

### Public Domain Reference Material

The general design language (half-figure court card composition,
traditional attributes such as Jack's halberd, Queen's rose, King's
scepter, ermine trim, and pointed collars) is inspired by the
**traditional European court card pattern**, which originates from
pre-1900 designs and is firmly in the public domain.
